[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the fifth is the largest, the second is the second-largest, the remaining three are of roughly the same size or else the fourth is the smallest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>

<p>The rostral is usually higher than it is wide. The mental is usually completely separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials, which meet behind the mental. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present, both are lower than the eye diameter. Eye diameter larger than the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal similar in length to frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.3 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales usually surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
</p>

<p>Tail starts to taper more rapidly in the second half or near the tip; tail tip is not blunt. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males from Borneo 0.100 - 0.124 (n = 9), in females from Borneo 0.056 - 0.091 (n = 17).

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Body and tail with several black stripes that may be very distinct against a golden or reddish ground color, but sometimes the stripes are not very evident or, rarely, not visible at all - especially if the body is unusually dark (brown). The head is often intricately patterned in red/golden contrasting with dark brown areas. There is a broad black ring a few scales behind the head, and usually two similar rings on the tail - one at the base, and often one close to the tip. There are also three black stripes along the tail - one on the top and one on each side. Between those black stripes and rings on the tail, the color is red or dark/dull reddish brown. The belly has no pattern but is yellow, orange, or red, sometimes lighter anteriorly; this light color usually reaches up onto the first dorsal scale row. Rarely may the lateral edges of the ventrals be dark.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>The distinctive pattern should normally prevent <i>C. leucogaster</i> from being mistaken for any other Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> species. Only very dull and dark specimens, in which the striped body pattern is not evident, might perhaps be mistaken for <i>C. lumholtzi</i> or (adults of) <i>C. bicolor</i>, both of which have a red and black pattern on the tail. The broad black ring behind the head — with no black crossbands across the rest of the back — is however characteristic for <i>C. leucogaster</i>. The narrow snout and almost wedge-shaped head - particularly evident when seen from above - is unusual for Bornean <i>Calamaria</i>, and may actually cause it to be mistaken for a <i>Pseudorabdion</i> sp.! However, all <i>Pseudorabdion</i> spp. have a pair of internasals sitting between the rostral and the prefrontals (<i>Calamaria</i> spp. do not), and they have 15 (not 13) dorsal scale rows.

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Known from Sabah, Brunei, several sites across Sarawak, East Kalimantan province and, according to the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192083/2037727">assessment</a>, <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> Central Kalimantan province. According to the latter source, records are from as high as 1200 m ASL on Mount Kinabalu; it also occurs near sea level. Also found on Sumatra, but a record from Java is doubtful.
