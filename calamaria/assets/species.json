The belly pattern varies too; some have a black-and-white checkered pattern, whereas others have black stripes along the edges of otherwise light (white or yellow) ventrals. Some specimens are olive green dorsally (with darker markings), others are medium brown; some are so dark brown dorsally that dark markings on the back are hardly discernible. There are a two or more light (white or yellow) patches on the sides of the neck, which may be connected to a light-colored belly."
