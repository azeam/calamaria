    """This app is meant to help you identify Calamaria spp. (that is, Reed Snakes) you might come across on Borneo.
    <br><br>
      These <a href="test">test</a> small and obscure snakes are often very difficult to identify just from their ’looks’. For several of 
      them, no color photographs seem to exist, and no photographs exist of living specimens. Some are only
      known from one or a handful specimens, often collected more than a century ago. 
      Some look different when young from when fully grown, and adults of the same species may come in 
      different patterns.
    <br><br>
      Because we still have limited knowledge of what these snakes may look like, the only way to 
      properly identify many of them is to look at details in their scalation. The multi-character 
      identification algorithm we use in this app looks primarily at their scales, and ignores the snake’s 
      color and pattern. Once you get a suggestion of likely candidate species, based on the characters 
      you have entered, you can go to the relevant species account and read what is known of the species’ 
      color and pattern, its known geographical and altitudinal range, and other tidbits. For many species we 
      also show photos contributed by friends of ours.\n\ṇThere are two types of pages within this app. 
      Some just contain the info in the page you see, and do not link to other pages in the app. 
      You can access all those pages via the Main Menu in the upper right corner of the screen. 
      Other pages are interconnected and linked; these have to do with data you enter in the app when 
      you try to identify a Calamaria-specimen. You start that identification process via the main menu 
      link to Identify your Calamaria. On the relevant pages you can erase all entered data by clicking 
      the red button saying RESTART ID, and start from scratch again.
