<p>Very little is known about how <i>Calamaria</i> spp. live their lives. They feed primarily on earthworms. They can be seen active on the forest floor at night, but probably spend much time hidden under leaf litter. Even if not often seen, pitfall trapping has shown that they can be highly abundant in some places. All <i>Calamaria</i> are oviparous, with clutches of 1 - 4 eggs. Predators probably include a wide range of vertebrates, such as the elapid snakes <i>Calliophis bivirgatus tetrataenia</i> and <i>Bungarus flaviceps</i>.
