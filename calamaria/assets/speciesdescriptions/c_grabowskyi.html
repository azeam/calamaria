[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length (or the third may be a little larger), the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal ca three-quarters of the frontal’s length; length of frontal similar to the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Usually five (occasionally four or six) scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail tapering gradually. Length ratio [tail length / total length] in males 0.085 - 0.104 (n = 15), in females 0.069 - 0.084 (n = 13).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>The anterior part of the body is plain brown or olive-brown with scattered dark spots that are about as large as a dorsal scale. The lower side of the neck is yellow, bordered above by an undulating dark band that is usually broken up to form black, downward-bending arches. The middle and posterior part of the body is usually reddish brown or even brick red, but in other specimens similarly colored as the (brown) neck. The first (lowermost) dorsal scale row usually has white centers that form a light, dark-edged stripe along the edge of the belly. The belly may be entirely yellow, but starting a short distance behind the neck some black pigmentation usually starts to appear. This may be restricted to the edges and the center of each ventral, giving the appearance of dark stripes. These dark markings may float together on the anterior edge of each ventral, with the posterior edge of each ventral still being yellow, giving a faintly banded appearance. The tail is yellow underneath, with a dark median stripe. Occasionally also the subcaudals may have dark anterior edges.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Similar in scalation to <i>C. suluensis</i> and <i>C. everetti</i>. The number of ventrals is often higher in <i>C. grabowskyi</i> than in <i>C. everetti</i> and <i>C. suluensis</i>. In both <i>C. grabowskyi</i> and <i>C. suluensis</i> the mental touches the anterior chin shields; in <i>C. everetti</i> it does not.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Known from many locations primarily in the eastern half of Borneo - northeastern Sarawak, Brunei (Das 2007), western and eastern Sabah, and throughout the eastern part of Kalimantan -- but has also been recorded near current-day Batang Ai National Park in southern Sarawak. These sites span from the lowlands up to at least 1430 m ASL. Endemic to Borneo.</p>

Notice the brick-red posterior of the dorsum contrasting with a somewhat olive color on the top of the neck, and the undulating black line on the side of the neck, bordered below with bright yellow - all of which is rather typical for this species.<br><br>

<figcaption>This <i>Calamaria grabowskyi</i> from the Crocker Range Park headquarters in western Sabah (altitude ca 1000 m) has a body that is not as brick-red posteriorly as the specimens depicted above. However, if you look closely you can see that it is more olive-colored anteriorly and then a little “warmer” colored on the middle and rear of the body.<br><br>

<figcaption>Underside of tail in a <i>Calamaria grabowskyi</i> from Sabah (FMNH 239994). Notice how the tail tapers gradually throughout its length. In this species it appears as if all individuals have a median band under the tail, like seen here. In some other Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> spp., that is a variable trait - some individuals have it, others do not.<br><br>
