[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first is the smallest, the fifth largest, the second, third and fourth are of rather similar size. Five lower labials; the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is higher than it is wide. Because of the narrow rostral, the nasals/nostrils point more forward than in other Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> spp. The mental is usually separated from the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter slightly smaller than the eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal about the same as, or slightly shorter than, length of frontal; frontal two-thirds to three-quarters the length of the parietal; parietal ca 1.5 times length of prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal usually touches the first three (rarely two) upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail thick, tapers a little from the vent, often somewhat more abruptly near the end. Length ratio [tail length / total length] in males 0.093 - 0.148 (n = 12), in females 0.072 - 0.093 (n = 7).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Adults differ in color from juveniles. Most adults are uniformly dark brown or black above; others have indistinct black crossbands. The first two (or thereabout) scale rows are usually light, with a distinct border to the dark dorsal side. That light ventrolateral stripe reaches up behind the head, reaching towards the rear edges of the parietals (similar to what is seen in some <i>C. hilleniusi</i> and some <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>). Scales on the first, or the first and second, dorsal scale row(s) may have black anterior corners, which may form a stripe on the lower side; occasionally these scales may be predominately black. The belly is red (or possibly orange), and may or may not have black spots. The underside of the tail is also red and may or may not have a dark median stripe. That red color reaches up onto the lower sides of the tail; either as a continuous red stripe along the tail or as a series of elongate spots (see photos below).</p>

<p>Juveniles have a red ground color with dark crossbands that are separated from each other by 3 - 6 (usually 4) rows of light dorsal scales. The dark crossbands are as wide as or narrower than the light interspaces. There may be 17 - 30 crossbands on the body and another 3 - 5 crossbands on the tail, thus overlapping with the number of crossbands in <i>Calamaria</i> cf. <i>hilleniusi</i>. Inger & Marx (1965: 153) said that juveniles have a yellow ground color. We suspect that they only saw preserved specimens that had faded from a red color in life.</p>

<p>On the 5th upper labial, some specimens have a rather characteristic light C-mark, or a light marking shaped otherwise, that may give additional cues to the identity.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria hilleniusi</i> has a similar scalation on the head, and juveniles may also have dark bands across a reddish body, but it has a mental that always touches the anterior chin shields (only rarely so in <i>C. bicolor</i>). Furthermore, the rostral is noticeably wider in <i>C. hilleniusi</i> than in <i>C. bicolor</i>.</p>

<p>Dark-headed specimens of <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> are often bi-colored with a dark dorsum and a light belly and lower sides, but they have a longer tail (higher subcaudal counts in females versus males) that tapers more gradually from the vent and is usually quite slender. <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> also has larger nostrils which are facing sideways, unlike the smaller and rather forward-facing nostrils in <i>C. bicolor</i>.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria lateralis</i> has a color and pattern similar to adult <i>C. bicolor</i>, and they have very similar scalation. The former has a very dark grey/brown belly and that color reaches up over the first dorsal scale row (whereas <i>C. bicolor</i> has at least some white pattern on the first dorsal scale row). The yellow lateral line in <i>C. lateralis</i> reaches the eye, whereas the light ventrolateral line in <i>C. bicolor</i> (and sometimes in other <i>Calamaria</i> spp.) bends up onto the temporal region.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Known from throughout Sarawak and from parts of Kalimantan. According to the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192119/2042548">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> it has also been found in Sabah, and it is said to occur mostly at 200 - 600 m ASL, with a record at 1100 m ASL in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak. Also known from Java.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>Beware that several photos posted online, suggested to show <i>C. bicolor</i>, either fail to show diagnostic characters or they show what is clearly <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i>. Remember, just because a <i>Calamaria</i> is bi-colored, it does not need to be a <i>Calamaria bicolor</i>!</p>

<figcaption>The same <i>Calamaria bicolor</i> from Kubah National Park, Sarawak, as seen above. Notice the very narrow rostral scale at the tip of the upper jaw, and how the nasal scales (and nostrils) bordering it points forward. Because of this forward-facing position, the lower side of the prefrontal scale does not have much of a depression (compare with <i>C. schlegeli</i>).<br><br>

<figcaption>A juvenile <i>Calamaria bicolor</i> from northeast Sarawak. Notice the very narrow rostral, the forward-facing nasals/nostrils, and the white marking that reaches up onto the temporal region. As this snake grow larger, we assume that dark pigment will take over and leave red areas on the sides of the tail (compare with the road-killed specimen seen above). The photographer confirmed that this snake had a mental that did not touch the anterior chin shields and 163 ventrals, which helped confirm its identity. <br><br>

<figcaption><i>Calamaria bicolor</i> from the Kelabit Plateau in northeast Sarawak (FMNH 131596). Notice that the first lower labials meet behind the rostral and thereby separate the rostral from the anterior chin shields. Also seen here are three gulars in the midline, sitting between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale. (Most <i>Calamaria</i> spp. have three such scales; it is deviations from that number that can help identify some snakes.)<br><br>

<figcaption>Underside of tail in <i>Calamaria bicolor</i> from Niah, Sarawak (FMNH 131595). This specimen appears to have a tail tip that is less thick and less blunt than Inger & Marx (1965) said is typical for <i>C. bicolor</i> - “tail thick, tapering slightly from base, abruptly near end to a blunt point”. Indeed, we find tail shape and tail tip “bluntness” to be rather subjective traits that can be difficult to score in the same way as other people have scored it.<br><br>
