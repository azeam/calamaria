[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is about as wide as it is high. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal ca three-quarters of the frontal’s length; length of frontal ca four-fifths of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.7 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail long. In males it is thick and tapers abruptly near the end to a sharp point. Females seem to have a tail that does not taper as abruptly at the end, and might even be classified as tapering gradually through much of its length. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.165 - 0.1167 (n = 3), in females 0.096 - 0.105 (n = 2).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>A discretely patterned snake that is mostly brown, with light dots on scales of the first (lowest) dorsal scale row, forming a light stripe low on the body side, ending at the vent, and bordered by dark pigment. Some specimens have a light ring around the body about six scales behind the parietals; it may be entire or interrupted mid-dorsally. The belly is light, as is the underside of the tail; there may or may not be a dark median stripe under the tail.

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria prakkei</i> is very similar in scalation to <i>C. suluensis</i>. Males of <i>C. prakkei</i> has a long tail with a higher subcaudal count (31 - 32 in the few known males) than in <i>C. suluensis</i> of either sex, and in male <i>C. prakkei</i> the tail is thick and starts to taper more rapidly close to the (sharp) tip, giving it a very sturdy appearance (see photos below). However, in female <i>C. prakkei</i> the tail tends to taper more like that of <i>C. suluensis</i>, and female <i>C. prakkei</i> have subcaudal counts overlapping those of <i>C. suluensis</i>. Inger & Marx (1965) used the tail shape to distinguish between these taxa, but we consider female <i>C. prakkei</i> to be potentially impossible to key out from <i>C. suluensis</i>. Unfortunately, their color and pattern are very similar, and we cannot offer any fool-proof way of distinguishing female <i>C. prakkei</i> from <i>C. suluensis</i>. As far as we know, <i>C. prakkei</i> has only been collected near Sandakan in Sabah, but that does not mean they cannot occur elsewhere on the island.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria everetti</i> and <i>C. modesta</i> also have a very similar scalation but their mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials meeting behind the mental (in <i>C. prakkei</i> as well as <i>C. suluensis</i> and <i>C. grabowskyi</i>, the mental touches the anterior chin shields).</p>

<p><i>Calamaria grabowskyi</i> usually has a rather characteristic reddish or brick-colored posterior body, contrasting with a less “warm” brown color anteriorly; it also has a quite different color and pattern on the side of the neck.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Only recorded from a site near Sandakan Bay, Sabah. According to the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192198/2054340">assessment</a>, <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> the locality where it has been found is nowadays cleared of essentially all forest and it might possibly be extinct. Consequently, it is listed as critically endangered (CR). An old record from Singapore is nowadays doubted; the species is (was) probably endemic to Borneo.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>Considering its status as critically endangered and possibly even extinct, current-day records would be of great importance. If you encounter a snake suspected to be <i>C. prakkei</i>, try to document it carefully yet very gently, with minimal handling, before letting it go where you found it. Photographing the underside of the tail as well as the underside of the head would be essential. Try to photograph the tail from all sides; not just the underside.

<figcaption>Tail underside of <i>Calamaria prakkei</i> paratype (RMNH RENA 10866a) from Sandakan Bay, Sabah. Its 24 subcaudals imply it is a female. The tail tends to taper a little just after the cloaca, then taper again near the tip, but not quite as steeply as in the male holotype and the other male paratypes.
