[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; they are as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter ca two-thirds of the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal about as long as the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.3 – 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials. The frontal is 2.5 – 3.5 times as wide as each supraocular.
</p>

<p>Tail tapers gradually from the vent. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.072 – 0.106 (n = 2?), in females 0.073 – 0.076 (n = 3?).
</p>

<p>Ventrals in males: 147 – 155 (n = 2?).<br>
    Subcaudals in males: 18 – 21 (n = 2?).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females: 154 – 161 (n = 3?).<br>
    Subcaudals in females: 14 – 16 (n = 3?).<br>
    </p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Based on examination of a handful preserved specimens, all of which were adults (317 – 370 mm total length), Inger & Marx (1965) described two different patterns. Most were uniformly brown above, light below, with the dark dorsal color ending abruptly on the third or the second dorsal scale row. One specimen had “21 narrow (2-3 scales wide) crossbands of lighter brown, towards rear of body crossbands become lighter”.</p>

<p>At least in the plain color form, just behind the head the yellow ventrolateral color sometimes reaches up in a peg that may reach onto the outer/posterior edge of the parietal, or there may be an isolated yellow spot on the parietal.</p>

<p>Many visitors to Poring Hot Springs at the foot of Mount Kinabalu have photographed a red-banded (in juveniles; see photo below) or red-blotched (in adults; see photo below) <i>Calamaria</i> that have a scalation matching <i>C. hilleniusi</i> almost perfectly – at least so in specimens photographed in detail by e.g. Attila Kobori. Snakes looking just like this have also been photographed at Ranau, not far from Poring, at Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserves in central Sabah, at Tabin Wildlife Reserve in eastern Sabah, and near Keningau in western Sabah. These red-banded or red-blotched snakes are presumably the cross-banded color form that Inger & Marx described: most of them seem to have about 19 – 21 red crossbands (not counting the red head in juveniles), and their scalation shows a good match with <i>C. hilleniusi</i>. Larger specimens get increasingly dark, and the red blotches are most prominent on the rear of the body and on the tail.
</p>

<p>The belly of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> is pale-colored at least anteriorly, although there may be diffuse black blotches especially at the edges of the ventrals. Some ventrals may have a dark pigmentation across the entire scale, and such scales may come in groups, which almost reminds of the ladder-patterned belly of <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>. However, dark ventral pigmentation in <i>C. hilleniusi</i> is not nearly as distinct as the alternating black-and-cream groups of ventrals in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>. The underside of the tail may be pigmented in dark altogether, or else the subcaudals are light with dark outer edges.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Juvenile <i>Calamaria bicolor</i> from at least some areas in Sarawak and probably Kalimantan have a bright red and black pattern, making them somewhat similar to the brightly colored juveniles of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> known from central Sabah. Like in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, the bright red color in juvenile <i>C. bicolor</i> gradually changes into mostly black as the snake matures.
</p>

<p>Regardless of the bright juvenile color, <i>C. hilleniusi</i> may be mistaken for <i>C. bicolor</i> as well as <i>C. schlegeli</i>, but the latter two have a mental that does not touch the anterior chin shields. Also, <i>C. hilleniusi</i> has a lower subcaudal count than most specimens of <i>C. schlegeli</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i>, especially if you are able to account for the focal snake’s sex. <i>Calamaria bicolor</i> has a rostral that is taller than it is wide, whereas in <i>C. hilleniusi</i> the rostral is wider than tall. Because of the wide rostral in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, the nasals/nostrils are facing sideways (laterally), whereas the narrow rostral in <i>C. bicolor</i> make the nostrils point more forward. <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> also has nostrils that face sideways, and they are noticeably larger than the nostrils of both <i>C. hilleniusi</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i>.
</p>

<p><i>C. hilleniusi</i> may be quite similar to <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> – both may have a reddish or a dark head, a body that is uniformly dark above, lighter low on the sides, with (or without) a yellow marking that originates from the yellow lower side of the neck and reaches up behind or over the temporal region and onto the parietal. They also share most scale characters. However, almost all <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> from Borneo have a distinct and very characteristic black-and-cream ladder-pattern on the belly (which is quite similar to the belly-pattern of the highly venomous Banded Coral Snake, <i>Calliophis intestinalis</i>). The eye is usually larger in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> than in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, although there may be some overlap. In <i>C. hilleniusi</i> the frontal is 2.5 – 3.5 times as wide as the supraocular, whereas in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> the frontal is 1.5 – 2.5 times as wide as the supraocular.
</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Museum specimens are from near Kota Kinabalu (Sabah) and near Samarinda (East Kalimantan province). The red-banded/blotched form we tentatively assign as <i>C. hilleniusi</i> is common at Poring, and also found in central Sabah. Endemic to Borneo.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>The two color forms occur side by side at e.g. Poring Hot Springs in Kinabalu Park. We hope that future studies will use molecular markers to try and reveal how these two forms are related to each other – are they really just different color morphs of <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, or are they two different species with very similar scalation?
</p>

[section]Photos[/section]

<p>The following four (five) photos show an adult snake of the ‘plain’ color form of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> from Poring Hot Springs, Kinabalu Park, Sabah. Its neck has a pattern like the <i>C. hilleniusi</i> photographed by Robert F. Inger, seen in Stuebing et al. (2014: 118). The number of subcaudals (14/15) agrees with <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, but not quite with e.g. <i>C. bicolor</i>. The rostral is wider than high (as in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>; in <i>C. bicolor</i> the rostral is higher than wide), and the nostrils/nasals are therefore not quite as forward-facing as they are in <i>C. bicolor</i>. The tail is too short (too few subcaudals) and the nostrils too small (compared to the eye size) for this to be a <i>C. schlegeli</i>. Although the subcaudal count agrees with a female of <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>, which may also have the yellow ‘peg’ reaching up onto the rear side of the head, the snake had a uniformly light (white to pale flesh-colored) belly which is unknown in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> specimens from Borneo. Furthermore, although the eye size in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> is somewhat variable, we have never seen any <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> with an eye as small as in the depicted snake. Finally, the frontal is wide as in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>; not as narrow as in <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>.</p>

<p>The following three photos show another adult <i>C. hilleniusi</i> from Poring, Sabah. This specimen had no red blotches on the back, and it lacked the yellow ‘peg’ that often reaches up onto the temporal region and parietal in <i>C. hilleniusi</i>. It had a mental that touched the anterior chin shields (not shown here), which rules out both <i>C. bicolor</i> and <i>C. schlegeli</i>. As can be seen from the first photo, the nostril is small and quite different from that in <i>C. schlegeli</i>. The eye is not very small, and could pass for a <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>. In this particular specimen the frontal is ca 2.5 times wider than the supraocular; that is just at the borderline value for distinguishing between <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> and <i>C. hilleniusi</i> and therefore not diagnostic. However, the ventral pattern is very different from <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> and instead in agreement with <i>C</i>. cf. <i>hilleniusi</i> from this locality.
