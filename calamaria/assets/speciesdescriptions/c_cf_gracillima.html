<p>The snake depicted below was found by Sam Howard adjacent to Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in Central Kalimantan province. Over a period of 50 days he recorded two individuals of this taxon, at an altitude of 330 – 480 m ASL. Both were caught in pitfall traps; none were found by the opportunistic surveys undertaken. According to Sam’s photos and field notes, these snakes were uniform iridescent brown with no markings. That contrasts with light lateral blotches in the holotype of <i>C. gracillima</i> (see photo at that species account), which was also mentioned by Inger & Marx (1965).</p>

<p>This snake resembles <i>C. gracillima</i> in terms of an extremely small eye, lacking a postocular, and a similar frontal-to-supraocular width ratio. It also lacks a preocular, but that is a trait of both <i>C. gracillima</i> and <i>C. lovii lovii</i> (as well as some other Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> spp.) and thus not as informative. However, as seen in one photo below, it has a mental that is in contact with the anterior chin shields – a character opposite to what is known for <i>C. gracillima</i> but in agreement with <i>C. lovii lovii</i>. We notice that the various subspecies of <i>C. lovii</i> differ in whether or not the mental touches the anterior chin shields. Also, Inger & Marx (1965:151) found that one out of 21 examined <i>C. bicolor</i> had a mental touching the anterior chin shields. Such rare deviations from the norm may go undetected when only a few specimens have been examined (and only three <i>C. gracillima</i> were available to Inger & Marx, 1965).</p>

<p>Although we do not see the underside, if we make the assumption that the dorsal scales are aligned with the ventrals, the depicted snake seems to have roughly 270 ventrals. That is intermediate between what is known from <i>C. lovii lovii</i> (190 – 254) and <i>C. gracillima</i> (290 – 304). Although 270 is considerably less than in the three specimens of <i>C. gracillima</i> examined by Inger & Marx (1965), it would be plausible for <i>C. gracillima</i> considering the wide ventral count range in some well-sampled <i>Calamaria</i> spp., such as <i>C. lovii lovii</i>. It is harder to accurately estimate how many subcaudals this snake had, but it appears (from the photo below and a photo not shown) to agree with the 12 – 13 subcaudals known from two female <i>C. gracillima</i> as well as the subcaudal count in female <i>C. lovii lovii</i> (11 – 18).</p>

<p>Most notably, the depicted snake appears to have no visible suture separating the first and second upper labials (i.e., they appear to be fused, and therefore only three upper labials are evident) – a character not known in any species of <i>Calamaria</i>. Even more remarkably, this snake has merely three (not five as in <i>C. gracillima</i>) lower labials, with only the first touching the anterior chin shield – also unheard of in <i>Calamaria</i>. It appears that the first three lower labials are fused.</p>

<p>We suspect that this snake represents a distinct taxon, separate from <i>C. lovii</i> and <i>C. gracillima</i>, but this cannot be confirmed without further study. Where to draw the line between variation within a species versus a difference large enough to warrant a split and the description of a new species is not an easy one, unless one has access to a decent sample with a good geographical coverage. Ideally, one would look at differences across geographical clines – are the genotypes and phenotypes similarly clinal, or are there abrupt stepwise differences?</p>

<p>Sam Howard has suggested to us that there may in <i>Calamaria</i> be an evolutionary gradient in morphology that correlates to degree of fossoriality (i.e., how subterranean their lifestyle is). Traits associated with more pronounced fossoriality may be reduction in eye size, reduction in / fusing of head scales, elongation of body, and loss of color / pattern. A short tail with a blunt tip may be other traits in such a morphological “syndrome” in the most fossorial <i>Calamaria</i> species. For a snake that pushes through the soil, having a small eye and fewer seams between scales may provide structural strength, less friction, and less risk of eye damage. Sam suggests that such a hidden (to us humans) lifestyle could explain why <i>C. gracillima</i> and the taxon dealt with here have been found so rarely. Sam also pointed out to us that [more] fossorial taxa probably have a comparatively low dispersal rate and would be candidates for speciation on small geographical scales.</p>
