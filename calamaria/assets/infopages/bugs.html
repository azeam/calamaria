<p>We would be keen to hear about factual errors as well as app bugs that you might notice. Of course, we would also be delighted if you let us know of range extensions, altitudinal extensions, and any other info that warrants inclusion in a (possible) revised app version.

<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:calamariaofborneo@gmail.com">calamariaofborneo@gmail.com</a> if you have anything to share with us concerning the genus <i>Calamaria</i> in Borneo. We might not check that email account very often, but we will check it eventually!
</p>

<p>If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions with regards to the core functionality of the app, it would be helpful if you file an issue at <a href="https://github.com/azeam/calamaria/issues">GitHub</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png">. If you are a developer and would like to help us improve the app you are also more than welcome to send a pull request, or use our open source code to make your own identification app for some other taxa!</p>
