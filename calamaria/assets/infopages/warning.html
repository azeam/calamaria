<p>READ THIS CAREFULLY before handling any snake!
</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="https://www.who.int/snakebites/disease/en/">estimates</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> that 81,000 – 138,000 people die from snake bite each year.
</p>

<p>Do not become one of those unfortunate victims.
</p>

<p>This app should NOT be seen as a reason for unsafe handling of snakes!
</p>

<p>If you are not already very knowledgeable in identification of the snakes of Borneo, <span>do not handle any snake unless you are absolutely sure it is harmless.</span></p>

<p>Some venomous elapid snakes are similar to harmless <i>Calamaria</i>-species.
</p>

<p>Even experts can misidentify snakes unless closely examined, and such mistakes can end fatally. You may die, or your companion in the field may die. One such fatal misidentification is well-known among herpetologists, and we know of near-misses that occurred in Borneo, when venomous Banded Coral Snakes were mistakenly thought to be harmless snakes.
</p>

<p>Those inexperienced in snake identification should always take a hands-off approach.

<figcaption>A bite by the dangerously venomous Blue Coral Snake (in Borneo, subspecies Calliophis bivirgata tetrataenia) may end very badly. Small juveniles could be mistaken for the red-headed form of the harmless Calamaria schlegeli. Can you tell which is which in this photo? Would you always make the correct identification in the middle of the night, when a partially obscured snake slithers through the leaf litter?

<p>For those with both ample snake experience and a keen desire to examine a snake closer, one way to <em>reduce</em> the risk of envenomation by a small (as in, <i>Calamaria</i>-sized) elapid snake is to use thick leather gloves with long sleeves, such as padded welding gloves or sturdy motorcycle gloves. But even that can be a risky strategy if the leather is worn. Using gloves also helps to reduce the risk that you lose blood from bites by snakes you correctly identify as <i>Calamaria</i> spp. — they often bite, and have sharp teeth. The disadvantage with using thick gloves is that you lose fine motor capability, which means you increase the risk of harming the snake by gripping it too hard.

<p>Another way to <i>somewhat</i> safely examine a small snake is to persuade it to crawl into a transparent plastic tube. Firmly plug one end so that the snake cannot crawl through and bite you (perhaps secure the plug with tape to be on the safe side); then hold the open end up to the snake’s head while touching its rear end with a stick. Keep your hands at a safe distance if you are not sure what kind of snake it is! The tube should ideally be just a little thicker than the snake so that it cannot turn around, and about as long as the snake. A tube that is 30 – 40 cm long and has a diameter of 15 mm might be suitable for adult <i>Calamaria</i>. That also means you can keep your fingers ca 30 cm away from the snake’s head, which should be safe if the snake is no longer than that and if you are fully focused on the task. When you are done, unplug the capped end, lay the tube down, and let the snake crawl out. It might need a gentle poke on the tail (use a stick). Use gloves as an extra safety precaution, should the snake find its way out of the tube when you least expect it. (If the snake is much thinner than the tube, it may turn around and come out from where it entered.) Never make a snake crawl into a tube that is no wider than the snake itself – the snake can get stuck! If you try to photograph the snake when it sits in the tube, you may find that the round shape of the tube results in unwanted reflections from your flash. To photograph ventral and subcaudal scales, flat-bottomed containers such as Petri dishes may be more suited (see <a href="photos">How to take photos for ID</a>). However, it can be difficult to coax a snake into a Petri dish and close the lid without getting your fingers very close to the snake. Safety first!

<p>Again:  Do NOT handle a snake unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE that it is harmless!
