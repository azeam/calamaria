[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length or else the second is a little larger, the fifth is the longest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental does not touch the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present, although the postocular might be seamlessly fused with the supraocular; neither the pre- or postocular is as tall as the eye. Eye diameter smaller than the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal slightly shorter than the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials. The frontal is ca 1.7 – 2.2 times as wide as each supraocular.
</p>

<p>Tail tapers gradually throughout its length and ends in a sharp (not blunt) tip.
</p>

<p>Ventrals in males: 146 (n = 1).<br>
    Subcaudals in males: 23 (n = 1).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females: 150 – 151 (n = 2).<br>
    Subcaudals in females: 16 – 18 (n = 2).    
    </p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Uniformly dark above as well as on the belly, with a yellow or possibly white lateral stripe that starts behind the eye, and continues on the second and part of the third dorsal scale row along the entire body (and, seemingly, throughout the tail).
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> may have a similar pattern, but its belly is light and its light lateral band sits lower – on the first (and maybe part of the second) dorsal scale row; it also has a larger nasal/nostril. Most <i>C. schlegeli</i> has a higher number of subcaudals, but the full and true range of subcaudals is poorly known in <i>C. lateralis</i>, so caution is warranted for this character. If the snake does not have a preocular, it should be <i>C. schlegeli</i> and not <i>C. lateralis</i> – but presence of a preocular could mean either of these two species. If the snake’s postocular is seamlessly fused with the supraocular, it would indicate <i>C. lateralis</i> – but a distinct seam between those scales may be present in both these species.
</p>

<p>Its distinct two-colored pattern may cause some to mistakenly think it is <i>C. bicolor</i> (the color and pattern of which has been much misunderstood). They share most scale characters used in the key, but look at the rostral – in <i>C. bicolor</i> it is narrow and tall, causing the nostrils to point forward, whereas in <i>C. lateralis</i> the rostral is wider than it is tall. They also differ in color and pattern, especially on the side and rear of the head (see the species account for <a href="speciesIndex1"><i>C. bicolor</i></a>), and there are usually (always?) red markings the lower sides of the tail in <i>C. bicolor</i>.
</p>

<p>Uniformly colored specimens of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> may be somewhat similar to <i>C. lateralis</i> in terms of color and pattern, but they usually have a light belly and they have a mental that touches the anterior chin shields.
Inger & Marx (1965: 143) say that some <i>C. modesta</i> may have dark pigment “covering entire width of ventrals”, but in individuals of <i>C. modesta</i> where a light ventrolateral stripe is present (not all of them have a stripe like that), it sits on the first – not the second and (part of the) third – dorsal scale row.
</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>In Borneo, only known from the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu, Sabah. Its altitudinal distribution is not well known, but a snake photographed by Rose Ragai (depicted below), which we believe is <i>C. lateralis</i>, came from near Kota Marudu on the northern side of Kinabalu Park; we suspect it may have been found at a fairly low altitude. It has also been recorded from Java.

<figcaption>This snake from near Kota Marudu, north of Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, is almost certainly <i>Calamaria lateralis</i> based on its dark ventral color and the placement of the yellow lateral stripe on the second (not first) dorsal scale row. It had a mental that was separated from anterior chin shields (discernible in a photo not shown in this app), which is in agreement with <i>C. lateralis</i>. It was also deemed that it had a short tail (which would be further counterindication of <i>C. schlegeli</i>), but no photographs show the tail. The photos are of too low resolution to evaluate the nasal/nostril size.
