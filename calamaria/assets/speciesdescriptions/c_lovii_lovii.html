[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Four upper labials, with the third or the second and third touching the eye; the fourth is the longest, the first and third are the shortest. Four of five lower labials, the first two of which touch the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is slightly higher than it is wide. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular almost always absent; postocular present, very rarely fused with the supraocular. Eye diameter about half the eye–to–mouth distance, and larger than the height of the postocular.</p>

<p>Prefrontal longer than the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal longer than the prefrontal. Frontal 2.5 – 4.3 times as wide as each supraocular. Six scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two or three upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail short and thick, and tapers slightly or abruptly at the end; the tail tip is usually blunt (although see photos below for variation in tail tip shape). Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.065 – 0.102 (n = 20), in females 0.031 – 0.052 (n = 33).</p>

<p>Ventrals in males: 190 - 222 (n = 21).<br>
    Subcaudals in males: 17 - 26 (n = 21).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females: 218 – 254 (n = 33).<br>
    Subcaudals in females: 11 – 18 (n = 33).
    </p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Highly variable pattern. Often dark dorsally with very large, light blotches on the sides of the body (especially anteriorly), but may also have lighter brown stripes along the sides and possibly top of the body, and may lack lateral blotches altogether. Some have small, light mid-dorsal spots; these may or may not be most evident in the anterior part of the body. The belly may be discretely patterned with some mottled darker pigment, or it may have a bold light and dark, almost checker-like pattern, somewhat similar to the black and cream ladder-pattern in <i>Calamaria lumbricoidea</i>. There may be light rings, or dorsally interrupted rings, around the tail.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Scalation-wise somewhat similar to <i>C. gracillima</i>, from which it is best distinguished by relative eye size (even smaller in <i>C. gracillima</i>), the relative width of the frontal vs. the supraocular (in <i>C. gracillima</i> the frontal 6 – 8 times as wide as supraocular). Supposedly, <i>C. gracillima</i> has a mental that does not touch the anterior chin shields (it does in <i>C. lovii lovii</i>), but as mentioned in the species account for <i>C. gracillima</i>, one confusing specimen that might be closer to <i>C. gracillima</i> than <i>C. lovii lovii</i> had a mental that touched the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria borneensis</i> also has a very variable color and pattern, and might be mistaken for <i>C. lovii lovii</i>. The former has a preocular (rarely present in <i>C. lovii lovii</i>), a larger eye, and it almost always has fewer ventrals (if you know the sex, the ventral ranges are non-overlapping).
</p>

<p><i>Calamaria virgulata</i> also has a tail that tapers rapidly near the tip, usually a striped body, and sometimes an interrupted ring at the base of the tail and a light tail tip. However, it has five upper labials (four in <i>C. lovii lovii</i>) and it has a preocular (rarely present in <i>C. lovii lovii</i>).</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Widespread in Sarawak; also recorded in western and eastern Sabah and the East Kalimantan province. It appears to be known from lower elevations only. Other subspecies occur in the Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore (ssp. <i>gimletti</i>; by some considered a full species), Java (ssp. <i>wermuthi</i>), and Vietnam (ssp. <i>ingermarxi</i>).</p>
