<p>Help us all to become wiser by sharing information on the <i>Calamaria</i> spp. you come across when in the field!
</p>

<p>If you manage to photograph it, post your observation to the web site <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png">. You do not need to be sure which species it is â€“ other users will tune in and help you identify the snake. Try to add as much relevant information as possible, especially any diagnostic characters that might not be clearly visible in your photo(s) but that you might have verified in the field. Spelling out such verified characters help us iNaturalist users to trust and agree on your record. Also try to add information on what altitude the snake was found at. You can get an altitudinal estimate from <a href="https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm">here</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png">, provided that you know where exactly (on the map) you made the observation.
</p>

<p>If you want to share knowledge for inclusion in a possible future version of this app, but lack a photo and therefore cannot post it to iNaturalist, <a href="mailto:calamariaofborneo@gmail.com">send us an email</a>!
<br><br>
We might not check that email account very often, but we will check it eventually.
