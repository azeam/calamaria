<p>Knowing the sex of the snake you have found can help narrow down the candidate species when you are able to count how many ventrals and subcaudals it has. (It may also have some bearing on how soon, or how much, the tail starts to taper after the vent.)
</p>

<p>Male snakes have two hemipenes – essentially a penis that over evolutionary time has become divided in two. The tip of each hemipene may in some snakes be further divided into two lobes. [See photo below.] When a snake does not use one of its hemipenes for mating, they sit inverted inside the base of the tail – one on the left side, the other on the right side. Professional herpetologists often insert a specially-designed, lubricated metal probe through the cloaca and try to see how far into the tail base it goes (inside one of the inverted hemipenes, if it is a male). In females the probe will not reach as deep; usually only one or two subcaudals beyond the cloaca. This procedure can easily injure (render sterile, or even mortally wound) a snake unless done properly. We therefore do NOT advocate the use of probing to sex snakes that keen naturalists encounter in the field – it should be left for professionals doing officially sanctioned research.
</p>

<p>However, sometimes male snakes evert one or two hemipenes when handled, e.g. if they tightly coil the tail around your fingers, which may cause the pressure inside the tail to increase and make the hemipenes “pop” out. Those experienced in snake handling can often help build up such a pressure in the tail base, and make hemipenes pop out of the cloaca. One gently but firmly uses the thumb and forefinger to grip the tail approximately 10 – 15 subcaudals posterior to the vent, and then applies a pressure while “rolling” your thumb up towards the cloaca, so that an internal pressure builds up gradually inside the base of the tail. If done correctly, it may cause the (rather long) hemipenes to pop out – and thus prove the snake to be male. If small knobs that are just a ventral long pop out, it could be scent glands as opposed to hemipenes. But a failure to “pop” long hemipenes does not necessarily mean the snake is a female – it may be that you did not perform the pressure correctly, or it may be that the snake has enough muscular force to counteract the pressure build-up and thereby prevent the hemipenes from popping out. So, this is a method with obvious limitations! If, in the data entry section, you enter that you saw hemipenes, the ID-algorithm will glean data for just male snakes. However, if you enter that you did not see any hemipenes, or if you skip over that page without entering anything, the app does not consider the snake to be a female but an un-sexed snake, and the algorithm will use data on ventral and subcaudal counts for males and females pooled.
</p>

<p>Trying to “pop” a snake can potentially harm it if excessive force is used. Please only consider using this method if you have been trained by experienced herpetologists to perform the procedure.
