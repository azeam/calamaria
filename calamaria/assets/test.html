<h2><i>Calamaria testus</i> L.</h2>
<h4>Scalation and shape</h4> Four upper labials, with the second and third touching the eye; first and third upper labials distinctly narrower than second; first slightly wider than third; fourth the longest. Four lower labials, the first two touching the anterior chin shields. Seen in profile, the rostral scale sticks out almost like a beak, and gives the head a pointed shape.
The rostral is higher than it is wide. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are usually three (rarely two) gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
Preocular usually smaller than postocular. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance, and (slightly) larger than the height of the pre- and postocular.
Length of prefrontal ca four-fifths of the frontal’s length; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Six scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
Tail tapers gradually. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.087 – 0.133 (n = 22), in females 0.061 – 0.087 (n = 26).
Ventrals in males: 126 – 169 (n = 24).
Subcaudals in males: 20 – 26 (n = 24).
Ventrals in females: 159 – 192 (n = 28).
<h4>Subcaudals in females</h4> 13 – 21 (n = 28).
Color and pattern: The color and pattern in Calamaria borneensis varies considerably. They may either have dark crossbars on the anterior third of the body, behind which the bars become smaller spots, or they may have small dorsal spots, or they may have narrow stripes along the body, or they may have small, elongate spots along the middle of the back. The belly pattern varies too; some have a black-and-white checkered pattern, whereas others have black stripes along the edges of otherwise light (white or yellow) ventrals. Some specimens are olive green dorsally (with darker markings), others are medium brown; some are so dark brown dorsally that dark markings on the back are hardly discernible. There are a two or more light (white or yellow) patches on the sides of the neck, which may be connected to a light-colored belly.
<h4>Similar species</h4> Calamaria borneensis can be rather similar to C. lovii lovii. Both may have a checker-patterned belly, both come in different colors and patterns, and they share several scale characters. The shape of the tail tip is often – but not always! – distinctly blunter in C. lovii lovii. The best way to tell them apart from a close-up photo of the head is the absence of a preocular in C. lovii lovii (present in C. borneensis). Also, the supraocular reaches in front of the eye in C. borneensis, whereas the anterior edge of the supraocular sits above the eye in C. lovii lovii. Further, in C. borneensis the prefrontals are shorter the frontal whereas in C. lovii lovii the prefrontals are longer than the frontal.
Several people have photographed Calamaria specimens in western Sarawak that were initially thought to be either C. melanota or C. battersbyi. However, a photo by Law Ing Sind (seen below) showing the chin in one of these specimens revealed that only the first two lower labials (on each side of the jaw) were in contact with the anterior chin shield(s). This is a character for C. borneensis; in both C. melanota and C. battersbyi the first three lower labials touch the anterior chin shield(s). We now believe that all these specimens are C. borneensis. Indeed, C. melanota has a very different pattern both dorsally and ventrally.
If doubt arises, look for the combination of four upper labials, preocular present, and – importantly – only two lower labials (on each side of the lower jaw) in contact with the anterior chin shield(s).
Geographical range: Known from Sarawak, Brunei, western Sabah, and northwestern Kalimantan. According to the IUCN Red List assessment, records so far come from up to 1100 m ASL. It is endemic to Borneo.
