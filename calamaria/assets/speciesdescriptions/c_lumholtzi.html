[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first and third are somewhat larger than the second and fourth, while the fifth is the largest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental is separated from the anterior chin shields (the first lower labials meet behind the mental). There are three or four gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular may be either present or absent; postocular present and lower than the eye diameter. Eye diameter smaller than the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal about as long as the frontal; length of frontal ca two-thirds of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first three upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail moderately thick, tapers more steeply in its last quarter. Inger & Marx (1965) said the tail has a “blunt tip”, but the museum specimen in the photo seen below has a pointed tail tip. Length ratio [tail length / total length] unknown in males, in females 0.053 - 0.056 (n = 3).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p><i>C. lumholtzi</i> has a rather characteristic pattern with a reddish head and a broad, reddish band along the top of the tail, contrasting with a rather uniformly brownish body. On the lower side is a lighter band, bordered below by a darker (possibly indistinct) stripe. The ventrals may be light, or with a darker speckling at each ventral scales anterior edge. The ventral photo below also shows an irregular pigmentation along the ventrals outer (lateral) edges. Contrasting to the light top of the tail are darker sides of the tail. The photo below of a living specimen assumed to be <i>C. lumholtzi</i> has less reddish pigmentation on top of the tail than seen in the preserved specimen.
</p>

<p>The light head has a darker blotch on the frontal and prefrontals, and may seemingly have darker blotches also on the parietals.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Other species that may have reddish heads are <i>C. schlegeli</i>, <i>C. hilleniusi</i>, and <i>C. lumbricoidea</i>. <i>C. schlegeli</i> has a longer and more slender tail, and it never has any reddish color on top of the tail. In <i>C. schlegeli</i> the nasal is larger than the postocular, whereas in <i>C. lumholtzi</i> the nasal is smaller than the postocular. The banded form of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> - and possibly all juveniles - have alternating red and black crossbars (or red blotches) along the body and tail; not just a reddish head and a reddish top of the tail. Also, there is no dark line below the light-colored ventrolateral side in <i>C. hilleniusi</i> (nor in <i>C. schlegeli</i>). Small juveniles of <i>Calamaria lumbricoidea</i> have light crossbands on the body, and a belly with a characteristic cross-banded pattern; it also has no red on top of the tail. Although Inger & Marx (1965) suggested that the tail shape differs between <i>C. lumholtzi</i> (“tapered in posterior fourth to a blunt tip”) and <i>C. hilleniusi</i> (“tapering gradually from base to a point”), we find that distinction to be less clear than they indicated. Whereas the tail in <i>C. lumholtzi</i> indeed tapers more rapidly in its last quarter, the tail tip may, as seen from the photos below, be quite pointed (not blunt).

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Two specimens were collected at “Tumbang Maruwei”, which appears to be close to Sungai Maruwai in the northeastern part of Central Kalimantan province. Another specimen came from “Sungai Merah”, which is west or west-northwest of Samarinda in East Kalimantan province. The IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192240/2060014">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> has a map that also indicates a site north of Banjarmasin, near the border between South Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, and a site west of Pulong Tau National Park in northeastern Sarawak.  A snake photographed at Lesan Dayak in East Kalimantan province (depicted below), some 240 km north of Samarinda, is also assumed to be this species. Endemic to Borneo.</p>

<p>The IUCN Red List assessment states it has been found from near sea level up to 1000 m ASL.</p>

<figcaption>A snake we believe is <i>Calamaria lumholtzi</i>, from Lesan Dayak in East Kalimantan province. The color and pattern of the head and the tail, and the tail length and tail shape, suggest so - even if this specimen has less extensive red pattern on top of the tail compared to USNM 51638 seen above. There is no other <i>Calamaria</i> on Borneo that should look like this, and it was found not very far from where <i>C. lumholtzi</i> has previously been recorded.
