[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; among the first four the second is a little larger than the others, the fifth is the longest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. In specimens from Borneo the mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter varies from noticeably smaller to slightly larger than the eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Prefrontal shorter than the frontal; length of frontal two-thirds to three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. In specimens from Borneo, five scales surround the paraparietal (elsewhere 5 – 6). The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Inger & Marx (1965) examined very few <i>C. virgulata</i> from Borneo. The key in this app uses the ventral and subcaudal counts from just Borneo (not the whole range). Below, we give both kinds of data.</p>

<p>Tail rather short (or very short in females) and only tapers near the end to a blunt tip. In specimens from Borneo, reduction to four dorsal scale rows occur alongside the 4th –8th (in males, n = 3) or the 1st – 5th (in females, n = 6) subcaudal anterior to the terminal scute (count from the end). Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males from across the entire range 0.050 – 0.102 (n = 20), in males from Borneo 0.070 – 0.074 (n = 3); in females from across the entire range 0.022 – 0.055 (n = 39), in females from Borneo 0.028 – 0.055 (n = 6).</p>

<p>Ventrals in males from across the entire range: 160 – 237 (n = 19).<br>
    Ventrals in males from Borneo: 178 – 183 (n = 3).<br><br>
    Subcaudals in males from across the entire range: 16 – 30 (n = 20).<br>
    Subcaudals in males from Borneo: 18 (n = 3).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females from across the entire range: 180 – 260 (n = 39).<br>
    Ventrals in females from Borneo: 194 – 205 (n = 6).<br><br>
    Subcaudals in females from across the entire range: 8 – 16 (n = 39).<br>
    Subcaudals in females from Borneo: 9 – 16 (n = 6).

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Dark brown above, with dorsal scales finely dusted with light, tiny specks. There are several darker stripes along the body, and the lowest dorsal scale row tends to form a lighter stripe. It appears as if all Bornean specimens have a light ring around the neck, some four to eight scales behind the head, but in other islands the ring may be lacking. In Borneo, the belly pattern is light with dark pigment only at the lateral edges (elsewhere, dark pigment may cover all but the rear edge of every ventral). There is usually a dark median stripe under the tail.

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Most easily confused with <i>C. everetti</i> and <i>C. modesta</i>, with which it shares almost all scale characters and which may look quite similar. Perhaps the best (yet somewhat subjective) way to tell them apart is that <i>C. virgulata</i> has a tail tip that is blunter than in the other two. Knowing the sex of the focal snake is helpful when comparing the number of subcaudals and alongside which subcaudal the number of dorsal scale rows are reduced to four. Also, in <i>C. virgulata</i> the frontal is 1.75 – 3.5 times as wide as each supraocular is wide, compared to 1.5 – 2 times as wide in <i>C. everetti</i>. (For comparison, <i>C. modesta</i> has a frontal that is 1.75 – 3 times as wide as each supraocular).</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Most records are from Sabah, but has also been found on Nunukan island in North Kalimantan province and on Mount (Batu) Tibang in East Kalimantan province, near the Sarawak border. The IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/183188/1731815">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> also states it has been recorded in Sarawak. Recorded from near sea level up to 1000 m at Mount Kinabalu. Also found in Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and the Philippines.</p>
