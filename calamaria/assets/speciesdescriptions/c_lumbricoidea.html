[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length or else the third is smaller, the fifth is the longest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral dimensions are variable – it may be wider than it is high, or higher than it is wide. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are usually three, sometimes four, gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present. Eye size variable – its diameter may be smaller than, equal to, or larger than the eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Prefrontal about as long as, or slightly shorter than, the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters or more of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Four or five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials. The frontal is ca 1.5 – 2.5 times as wide as each supraocular.</p>

<p>Tail thick, tapering abruptly near the end, and ends in a sharp (not blunt) tip. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males from Borneo 0.075 – 0.115 (n = 21), in females from Borneo 0.051 – 0.085 (n = 18).</p>

<p>Ventrals in males from Borneo: 144 – ca 181 (n = 23).<br>
    Subcaudals in males from Borneo: 19 – 26 (n = 23).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females from Borneo: 137 – ca 200 (n = 18).<br>
    Subcaudals in females from Borneo: 14 – 21 (n = 19).
    </p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Highly variable in color and pattern both geographically and when comparing juveniles to adults. First look at the belly. In Borneo, almost all individuals have a distinctly crossbanded belly with alternating black and cream-colored (or white) ventral scales. The black crossbands usually consist of 2, 3, or 4 adjacent black ventrals (at the edges of such groups of black ventrals, often just one side of a ventral is black); rarely are just single ventrals or almost all ventrals black.</p>

<p>The juveniles have a reddish head and (in Borneo) narrow white crossbands across the back. The crossbands become wider low on the sides. Specimens from eastern Sabah and North Kalimantan province may have red dorsal blotches in these crossbands, crossbands that are yellow rather than white on the lower sides, and the crossbands may be wider than in specimens from e.g. Sarawak and Brunei.</p>

<p>As the snake grows larger, the crossbands fade away and the head gets darker. Adults are rather uniform brown dorsally. There may be a yellowish stripe along the first (lowest) scale rows on each side, and this band may reach up behind the head, over the temporal region and onto the parietals (similar to the pattern in some specimens of <i>C. hilleniusi</i>; also reminiscent of the pattern in <i>C. bicolor</i>).</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><span>BEWARE</span> that the venomous Banded Coral Snake (<i>Calliophis intestinalis</i>) has a similarly patterned belly, and may have a similarly reddish head!</p>

<p>The dorsally crossbanded juveniles could be mistaken for the yellow-banded form of <i>Calamaria</i> cf. <i>schlegeli</i> known from eastern Sabah, but the latter do not (as far as known) have a red head, nor a crossbanded belly.</p>

<p>There are additional <i>Calamaria</i> spp. in Borneo that may have a red head (<i>C. hilleniusi</i>, <i>C. lumholtzi</i>), but none of them have white crossbands across a black back. Whereas juvenile <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> from other regions might lack the light dorsal crossbands, that does not seem to apply for specimens from Borneo.
</p>

<p>Unless one looks at the belly, adult <i>C. lumbricoidea</i> may be mistaken for <i>C. hilleniusi</i> (which has a broader frontal, when comparing to the width of the supraoculars), the uniformly colored form of <i>C. schlegeli</i> (which has a tail that tapers more gradually, a mental that does not touch the anterior chin shields, and larger nostrils), and <i>C. bicolor</i> (which has a narrower rostral and more forward-facing nasals/nostrils).
</p>

<p>Some individuals of <i>C. lovii lovii</i> may have a similar belly pattern, with alternating dark and light ventrals; some of which are light on one side and dark on the other side (see photo associated with that species account).
</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Appears to be distributed throughout the island, from the lowlands up to at least 1430 m ASL on Mount Kinabalu. Found from southern Thailand via Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra to Java and to the Philippines.
