[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is about as wide as it is high. The mental does not touch the anterior chin shields, because the first pair of lower labials reach down and meet behind the mental. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal ca three-quarters of the frontal’s length; length of frontal at least four-fifths of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 - 1.7 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail tapers gradually. Reduction to four dorsal scale rows occur alongside the 13th - 21st subcaudal anterior to the terminal scute (count from the end). Length ratio [tail length / total length] in males 0.083 - 0.133 (n = 4), in females 0.078 - 0.102 (n = 4).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Presumably brownish dorsally. Some scales have a darker center, which at least in the anterior part of the snake forms dark longitudinal stripes. These stripes are presumably more prominent in juvenile specimens. The first (lowest) dorsal scale row has light centers, forming a light ventrolateral stripe; often bordered above and below by narrow dark stripes. There may or may not be a vertical marking at the rear of the head. About 6 to 8 scales behind the head, there might (or might not) be a full or a dorsally interrupted light-colored ring. The brownish head is spotted or mottled with darker color. The belly is light (yellow?), except for dark outer (lateral) tips of the ventrals; large individuals may also have a dark spot in the center of the ventrals. The tail is light underneath, with or without a dark midventral stripe.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Very similar in both scalation and pattern to <i>C. modesta</i>, <i>C. virgulata</i> and <i>C. suluensis</i>. Might also be mistaken for <i>C. prakkei</i> and <i>C. grabowskyi</i>.</p>

<p>Distinguishing <i>C. everetti</i> from <i>C. modesta</i> is very difficult. Inger & Marx (1965: 133, 141) used the following character: If, on the tail, the reduction in the number of dorsal scale rows to four occurs 13 or more subcaudals in front of the terminal (tail tip) scute, then it is <i>C. everetti</i>; if that reduction occurs 11 or fewer subcaudals from the terminal scute it is <i>C. modesta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria virgulata</i> has a higher number of ventrals, often fewer subcaudals, and a blunter tail tip than <i>C. everetti</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>C. suluensis</i>, <i>C. prakkei</i> and <i>C. grabowskyi</i>, the mental touches the anterior chin shields, whereas in <i>C. everetti</i> it does not. Also, <i>C. grabowskyi</i> often has a higher ventral count than either <i>C. everetti</i> or <i>C. suluensis</i>.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Known from Kuching and several other sites in northeastern Sarawak; eastern Sabah; Nunukan Island and the Bornean mainland south thereof (North Kalimantan province); and Batu Tibang in East Kalimantan province, not far from the border to Sarawak. These sites span from the lowlands up to 1500 m ASL. Endemic to Borneo.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>We are not aware of any photos of living specimens of <i>C. everetti</i>, so document it very well if you come across it! Because of the difficulty of distinguishing between <i>C. everetti</i> and <i>C. modesta</i> (and <i>C. virgulata</i>), try to photograph the scalation all around the tail - from a ventrolateral aspect, gradually through a dorsal aspect, and over to the other ventrolateral side. Try and have someone rotate the snake, with the tail sticking straight out, while you take a series of photographs. You must also see the ventral side and be able to count all subcaudals. That way you can later try and identify exactly where on the tail the dorsal scales are reduced to just four rows. As always, also photograph the chin of the snake.</p>
