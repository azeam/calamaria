[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Four upper labials, with the second and third touching the eye; the first three are of roughly the same size or else the third is a little smaller, the fourth is the longest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials, which meet behind the mental. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular absent; postocular present, lower than the eye diameter. Eye diameter smaller than the eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Prefrontal as long as, or longer than, than the frontal; length of frontal ca two-thirds of the parietal’s length; parietal 1.3 - 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Six (or possibly five) scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Tail tapers mostly in its posterior half in what we assume are males, but may be slenderer in females; tail tip is somewhat blunt. Length ratio [tail length / total length] unknown in males, in a female 0.075 (n = 1).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>A snake with no pattern; just a uniform dark grey, dull brown, or almost black dorsal and lateral color, and with no markings on the head. The scales may be iridescent. The belly is also without any pattern, often a bit lighter in the anterior part.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>The combination of a complete lack of pattern, four upper labials, and lack of preocular makes it easy to distinguish C. schmidti from all other Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> spp.</p>

<p>However, at Mount Kinabalu it is known to occur in sympatry with <i>Pseudorabdion collaris</i> which looks very similar. Like in all <i>Pseudorabdion</i> spp., <i>P. collaris</i> has a pair of internasals sitting between the rostral and the prefrontals; it also has parietals that are more than twice as long as the frontal, whereas in <i>C. schmidti</i> the parietals are less than twice as long as the frontal. Further, <i>P. collaris</i> has five (not four) upper labials and 15 (not 13) rows of dorsal scales.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Only known from around Mount Kinabalu in Sabah where, according to the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192016/2028396">assessment</a>, <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> it has been found at altitudes between 1370 and 1700 m ASL. Although Inger & Marx (1965) only had access to two specimens, it is actually very abundant around the Kinabalu Park headquarters. An indication of this is that Sam Howard captured more than 260 individuals (!) when pitfall trapping at the park (IUCN, op. cit.). It is often encountered on forest trails and roads when you walk around at night.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>You can help enhancing our knowledge about this species by photographing the underside, so that the number of ventrals and subcaudals can be counted from the photos. Show those photos and mention your counts if you post the observations to e.g. iNaturalist. Notice, though, that capturing snakes is not allowed in national parks unless you have a permit to do so.</p>
