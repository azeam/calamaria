[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length or else the second is a little larger, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is marginally wider than it is high. The mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter may be slightly smaller to slightly larger than the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal shorter than the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. In specimens from Borneo, five scales surround the paraparietal (elsewhere 5 - 6 or rarely 4 - 7). The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.</p>

<p>Because Inger & Marx (1965) examined very few <i>C. modesta</i> from Borneo, the key in this app uses the ventral and subcaudal counts from the whole range (not just Borneo) even though there appears to be some geographical differences. Below, we give both kinds of data.</p>

<p>Tail tapers gradually. In specimens from Borneo, reduction to four dorsal scale rows occur alongside the 9th (in male, n = 1) or the 5th - 7th (in females, n = 3) subcaudal anterior to the terminal scute (count from the end). Length ratio [tail length / total length] in males from across the entire range 0.088 - 0.155 (n = 90), in a male from Borneo 0.091 (n = 1); in females from across the entire range 0.050 - 0.073 (n = 69), in females from Borneo 0.053 - 0.055 (n = 3).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Varies much, and varies geographically; poorly known in Borneo. Essentially brown or dark brown above, with some darker spots, that may or may not form dark lines or short, elongated spots dorsally. There may or may not be a light line along the first dorsal scale row, bordered above and below by dark lines. There may or may not be light patches on the side of the neck. The belly pattern varies much - the ventrals may be light with just dark outer ventral corners, or almost entirely dark; in some there is a narrow light band along the middle of the belly (see photo below of an enigmatic specimen that might be a <i>C. modesta</i>). Specimens from Java look differently - they tend to have an almost black head with yellow spots; not the brownish head with dark spots seen in Bornean specimens.

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria virgulata</i> has a scalation very similar to that of <i>C. modesta</i>. For both of them, we know very little about their true range of ventrals and subcaudals (in specimens from Borneo), although it appears that <i>C. virgulata</i> has more ventrals than does <i>C. modesta</i>. To tell them apart, Inger & Marx (1965:59) used the shape of the tail tip: it is “blunt” in <i>C. virgulata</i>, while “tapering to a point” in <i>C. modesta</i>. Compare photos below with those in the account for <i>C. virgulata</i>.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria everetti</i> also has a scalation very similar to <i>C. modesta</i> and <i>C. virgulata</i>, and especially the former two may look very similar. To tell them apart, Inger & Marx (1965) used a character that is difficult to score in a living (moving) snake: whether the reduction on the tail to just four dorsal scale rows occurs 13 or more subcaudals from the tail tip (= <i>everetti</i>) or else 11 or fewer subcaudals from the tail tip (= <i>modesta</i> / <i>virgulata</i>).</p>

<p><i>Calamaria prakkei</i> and <i>C. suluensis</i> have a mental that touches the anterior chin shields.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>The IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/176628/1442853">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> lists three sites in Borneo - southwestern Sabah at 750 m ASL, eastern, Mount Kinabalu (Sabah) at 1370 and 1430 m ASL, and a record from eastern Sabah. Elsewhere it occurs in Java, Sumatra and Simeulue island west of Sumatra.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>We are not aware of any verified photos of living specimens of <i>C. modesta</i>, so document it very well if you come across it! Because of the difficulty of distinguishing between <i>C. modesta</i> and <i>C. everetti</i> (and <i>C. virgulata</i>), try to photograph the scalation all around the tail - from a ventrolateral aspect, gradually through a dorsal aspect, and over to the other ventrolateral side. Try and have someone rotate the snake, with the tail sticking straight out, while you take a series of photographs. You must also see the ventral side and be able to count all subcaudals. That way you can later try and identify exactly where on the tail the dorsal scales are reduced to just four rows. As always, also photograph the chin of the snake.

<p>Shown below are five photos of an enigmatic snake (FMNH 152152) that was collected by Lord Medway in “North Borneo” (nowadays Sabah), lodged in the Field Museum collection under the name <i>C. virgulata</i>. Although collected in January 1964, it was not part of the snakes examined by Inger & Marx for their 1965 monograph and we do not know who identified it. It has ca 25 subcaudals which is higher than in the few known Bornean specimens of <i>C. virgulata</i> and <i>C. modesta</i> (but in agreement with <i>C. prakkei</i>). A subcaudal count of 25 is however within the range seen in <i>C. modesta</i> specimens from Java (13 - 29). The tail tip seems not blunt enough to be <i>C. virgulata</i>. The striking ventral pattern falls within the wide variation seen in <i>C. modesta</i>, but seemingly not with <i>C. prakkei</i>. Its true identity remains to be confirmed.
