[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the fifth is the longest, the second is a bit larger than the first, third, and fourth. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials, which meet behind the mental. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular missing; postocular present, not as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter smaller than eye–to–mouth distance.</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal shorter than the frontal; frontal shorter than the parietal; parietal longer than the prefrontal. Paraparietal surrounded by five scales; it is not as elongated as in most <i>Calamaria</i> but rather square. The prefrontal touches the first three upper labials.</p>

<p>The male holotype (which is the only known specimen) has a tail that is long and thick, and tapers only in the second half to a somewhat blunt tip. It is possible that females have a tail that tapers a bit more gradually (compare with sex difference in <i>C. prakkei</i>). Length ratio [tail length / total length] in male holotype 0.152 (n = 1), females unknown.</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>The holotype is brown dorsally and has a uniformly light belly. The scales on the first (lowest) dorsal row has light centers, which form a light line along the lower side of the body, bordered below and above by thin dark stripes. The scales on the second and, to some extent, the third dorsal row also have some light in the center, but less so than those of the first row.

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria prakkei</i> has a similarly long and thick tail (especially the males), and a similar color and pattern. However, in <i>C. prakkei</i> the mental touches the anterior chin shields, a preocular is present, and the eye diameter is larger than the eye-to-mouth distance - opposite the characters in <i>C. rebentischi</i>.</p>

<p>Similar to <i>C. prakkei</i> and thus unlike <i>C. rebentischi</i>, <i>C. suluensis</i> (as well as <i>C. grabowskyi</i>) has a preocular, a mental that touches the anterior chin shields, and an eye diameter that is larger than the eye-to-mouth distance.</p>

<p><i>Calamaria modesta</i> has a preocular.</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>C. virgulata</i> that lack light rings around the neck and tail may be patterned somewhat similar, but they have a shorter tail (max 18 subcaudals) than <i>C. rebentischi</i> presumably ever has.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>The holotype was collected >160 years ago and came from Singkawang, on the coast of Western Kalimantan province near the westernmost tip of the island. No further specimens are known, and the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192239/2059891">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> highlights the loss of forest in that region, raising concerns about its status. It is currently listed as DD (data deficient).</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>Considering the possibly perilous status and our poor knowledge of this taxon, current-day records would be of great importance. If you encounter a snake suspected to be <i>C. rebentischi</i>, try to document it carefully yet very gently, with minimal handling, before letting it go where you found it. Photographing the side and underside of the head, as well as the underside of the tail, would be essential.</p>
