[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Four upper labials, with the second and third touching the eye; the second is (almost) as long as the fourth, the third is half as long as the second, the first is slightly longer than the third. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>

<p>The rostral is higher than it is wide. The mental does not touch the anterior chin shields, because the first pair of lower labials reach down and meet behind the mental. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular absent; there is no distinct postocular (it is considered to be fused with the small supraocular). Eye diameter much smaller than eye–to–mouth distance; smaller than in any other <i>Calamaria</i> from Borneo.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal much longer than the frontal; length of frontal ca two-thirds of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.25 times as long as the prefrontal. Frontal 6 – 8 times as wide as each supraocular. Six scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
</p>

<p>Tail short and tapers abruptly; the tail tip is blunt. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.035 (n = 1), in females 0.028 – 0.035 (n = 2).
</p>

<p>Ventrals in males: 295 (n = 1).<br>
    Subcaudals in males: 15 (n = 1).<br><br>
    Ventrals in females: 290 – 304 (n = 2).<br>
    Subcaudals in females: 12 – 13 (n = 2).
    </p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Dark brown above and below, with widely spaced yellow spots on the sides of the body in the anterior third of the body, and yellow spots at the root of the tail plus another one or two such spots also anterior to the vent.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>Calamaria gracillima</i> is similar to <i>C. lovii lovii</i> in several respects, but the latter has 190 – 254 ventrals. Also, the relative width of the supraocular compared to the frontal differs between them: in <i>C. lovii lovii</i> the frontal is less than 4.5 times as wide as the supraocular, whereas in <i>C. gracillima</i> the frontal is 6 – 8 times as wide as the supraocular. In <i>C. gracillima</i> there is no separate postocular (at least so in the three specimens examined by Inger & Marx 1965), whereas in <i>C. lovii lovii</i> those two scales are usually not fused, but clearly distinguishable. As far as known, males of <i>C. lovii lovii</i> have a longer relative tail length than males of <i>C. gracillima</i>, but there is little or no such difference for females.
</p>

<p>A highly enigmatic snake found by Sam Howard adjacent to Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in Central Kalimantan province shows some scale characters typical of <i>C. gracillima</i>, some of <i>C. lovii lovii</i>, and other characters not known in any <i>Calamaria</i>. It probably represents an undescribed taxon. Given how unique that individual is, we have given it an <a href="speciesIndex3">account of its own</a> – which is not covered in the key of this app.
</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>The only specimen with a precise locality came from Matang, just east of present-day Kubah National Park in western Sarawak. Two other specimens were from “Sarawak” and “Borneo”. Endemic to Borneo.
</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>We are not aware of any photos of living specimens. If you find a snake resembling <i>C. gracillima</i> or the enigmatic snake mentioned under “similar species”, try to carefully document the chin, and take photos clearly showing both the upper and the lower labials. Also remember to take photos from which you can count ventrals and subcaudals.
