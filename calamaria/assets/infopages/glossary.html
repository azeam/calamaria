<p>Not all the terms listed in the glossary below are used in this app, but they may be used in other literature on <i>Calamaria</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Adult</b>   Sexually mature</li>
<li><b>Allopatric</b>   Populations of two taxa living in non-overlapping areas are allopatric.</li>
<li><b>Anal</b>   The orifice at the base of the tail, although sometimes used to refer to the anal scale.</li>
<li><b>Anal scale</b>   The broad scale on the belly just before the anal opening (i.e., in front of the vent). In all Calamaria spp. it is “entire” (undivided; not divided in left and right halves).</li>
<li><b>Anterior</b>   Towards the front of the body.</li>
<li><b>ASL</b>   Above Sea Level (e.g., “up to 1500 m ASL”)</li>
<li><b>Caudal</b>   Referring to the tail.</li>
<li><b>cf.</b>   An abbreviation for “confer” (=compare with); used to indicate that the focal individual is similar to, but not necessarily conspecific with, the named taxon. Example of usage: Calamaria cf. hilleniusi.</li>
<li><b>Chin shields</b>   Two pairs of large scales under the chin (anterior vs. posterior chin shields).</li>
<li><b>Cloaca</b>   The cavity inside the anus.</li>
<li><b>Conspecific</b>   Belonging to the same species.</li>
<li><b>Congeneric</b>   Belonging to the same genus.</li>
<li><b>Crepuscular</b>   Active at dawn and dusk.</li>
<li><b>Cryptic species</b>   Two or more species that are difficult or impossible to distinguish between based on their morphology (including color and pattern), but different enough genetically to be considered separate species.</li>
<li><b>Dimorphism</b>   Occurring in two forms (two “morphs”).</li>
<li><b>Diurnal</b>   Active during the day.</li>
<li><b>Dorsal</b>   Referring to something on the back (dorsum).</li>
<li><b>Endemic</b>   Restricted to a certain area (e.g., “endemic to Borneo”).</li>
<li><b>Fossorial</b>   Burrowing; living underground.</li>
<li><b>Frontal</b>   A large scale (plate, scute) on the top of the head, between the eyes, that may be hexagonal or somewhat triangular in shape.</li>
<li><b>Gular</b>   Referring to the throat. Gular scales are those behind the posterior chin shields, in front of the first “proper” ventral.</li>
<li><b>Hemipenes</b>   The two halves of the bifurcated (=divided into two) penis of squamate reptiles. Only one hemipene is used when mating. When not in use, they are stored inverted in the base of the tail.</li>
<li><b>Hybridization</b>   Interbreeding, crossbreeding.</li>
<li><b>Internasals</b>   Two scales sitting on top of the snout, between the nostrils/nasals, in front of the prefrontals. These scales are missing in Calamaria spp.</li>
<li><b>Infralabials</b>   Lower labial (lip) scales.</li>
<li><b>Juvenile</b>   Not yet sexually mature.</li>
<li><b>Labial</b>   Lip scale.</li>
<li><b>Lateral</b>   Referring to something on the side.</li>
<li><b>Loreal</b>   A scale that sits above the upper labials, between the nostril and the eye or the preocular. Missing in Calamaria spp.</li>
<li><b>Mental</b>   The scale at the very front of the lower jaw, below where the tongue comes out.</li>
<li><b>Nasal</b>   The scale surrounding the nostril. In some snakes (such as Pseudorabdion spp.) it can be poorly defined and almost merged with the first upper labial. It may or may not be partially divided by a suture that reaches the nostril.</li>
<li><b>Nocturnal</b>   Active at night.</li>
<li><b>Nostril</b>   The opening through which the snake breathes.</li>
<li><b>Ocular</b>   Referring to the eye, possibly the transparent scale (“brille”) that covers the snake’s eye.</li>
<li><b>Ontogenetic</b>   Referring to some transition through the animal’s life (such as a gradual color change).</li>
<li><b>Oviparous</b>   Egg-laying.</li>
<li><b>Paraparietal</b>   A scale sitting behind/below the parietal, and behind /above the last upper labial.</li>
<li><b>Parapatric</b>   Populations that differ genetically and live in adjacent areas, with limited gene exchange in a narrow contact zone, are parapatric.</li>
<li><b>Parietals</b>   Two scales sitting behind the frontal, on the top/rear of the head.</li>
<li><b>Polymorphism</b>   Occurring in several forms.</li>
<li><b>Postocular</b>   Small scale sitting just behind the eye. In Calamaria spp. there is just one such scale or, rarely, none at all.</li>
<li><b>Prefrontal</b>   A pair of large scales sitting in front of the frontal. In Calamaria spp. these scales touch the rostral.</li>
<li><b>Preocular</b>   Small scale sitting just in front of the eye. In Calamaria spp. there is just one such scale or, rarely, none at all.</li>
<li><b>Rostral</b>   The scale at the very front of the upper jaw, above where the tongue comes out.</li>
<li><b>Scute</b>   Another word for scale; mostly used for larger scales (not dorsal scales).</li>
<li><b>sp.</b>   “species”, singular form; used when it is not clear which species (of a specified genus) it is.</li>
<li><b>spp.</b>   plural form of “sp.”</li>
<li><b>ssp.</b>   “subspecies”, singular form; used when it is not clear which subspecies it is.</li>
<li><b>sspp.</b>   plural form of “ssp.”</li>
<li><b>Subcaudal</b>   Literally, “under the tail”; the scales on the underside of the tail.</li>
<li><b>Supralabial</b>   Upper labial (lip) scale.</li>
<li><b>Supraocular</b>   Small scale above the eye. Present in all Calamaria spp., but may in some be restricted to the upper rear corner of the eye.</li>
<li><b>Suture</b>   Seam / border between two scales / scutes.</li>
<li><b>Sympatric</b>   Populations of taxa occupying the same geographic area are sympatric / live in sympatry.</li>
<li><b>Syntopic</b>   Like sympatric, but with co-occurrence at the exact same site (e.g., “C. schmidti and C. griswoldi are syntopic at the Kinabalu Park headquarters”).</li>
<li><b>Temporal</b>   Scales located in the temporal region, to the rear of the eye. Not often used when characterizing Calamaria spp., but the paraparietal and the smaller scales adjacent to it may be considered temporals.</li>
<li><b>Vent</b>   Often used casually, referring to something related to the cloaca; e.g. “snout-vent length” (distance of head+body, excluding the tail). Can also refer to the anal scale.</li>
<li><b>Venter</b>   Underside, belly.</li>
<li><b>Ventral</b>   Referring to the ventral scales, or to something on the belly (e.g., “ventral pattern”).</li>
<li><b>Ventrolateral</b>   Referring to the border between belly and side of the body.</li>
<li><b>Vertebral</b>   Referring to the center of the dorsum (back), usually the central dorsal scale row.</li>
<li><b>Viviparous</b>   Live-bearing.</li>
