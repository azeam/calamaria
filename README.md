## Note

The code base is unlicensed and free to use as you like (hopefully as base for more identification apps!), but all photos in the app are copyrighted by their respective owners and are not included in this repo. The project was initiated while Flutter was in a rather early state and there are plenty of hacks to work around text formatting issues etc. Any future work on this app should be focused towards updating the code base, third party libraries and implement Flutters "new" null safety.
## Instructions

Open Flutter project in Android Studio. Keep in mind that directory for the source is in the calamaria folder.

The data for species are located in assets/species.json
