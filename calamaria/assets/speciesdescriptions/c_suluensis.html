[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Length of prefrontal ca four-fifths of the frontal’s length; frontal length varies from three-quarters of the parietal’s length to equally long as parietal; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
</p>

<p>Tail tapering gradually. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.079 - 0.104 (n = 6), in females 0.064 - 0.109 (n = 12).</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Body brownish above; each dorsal scale has a fine mottling or is “dusted” with tiny olive (or possibly golden) specks, which may give the snake an olive tint. There are some darker, elongated markings on some of the dorsal scales, which may result in a dashed or faintly striped dorsal pattern. The lowermost (first or first and second) dorsal scale row(s) are yellowish, forming a stripe low on the side; this may be bordered below by a darker stripe. The belly is usually plain yellow (possibly orange), but is some specimens there is a black median stripe along the belly. Tail similarly colored, with or without a median stripe.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p><i>C. prakkei</i> is very similar in scalation to <i>C. suluensis</i>. Males of <i>C. prakkei</i> have a long tail with a higher subcaudal count (31 - 32 in the few known males) than in <i>C. suluensis</i> of either sex, and in male <i>C. prakkei</i> the tail is thick and starts to taper more rapidly close to the (sharp) tip, giving it a very sturdy appearance (see photos in the account for <i>C. prakkei</i>). However, in female <i>C. prakkei</i> the tail tends to taper more like that of <i>C. suluensis</i>, and female <i>C. prakkei</i> have subcaudal counts overlapping those of <i>C. suluensis</i>. Inger & Marx (1965) used the tail shape to distinguish between these taxa, but we consider female <i>C. prakkei</i> to be potentially impossible to key out from <i>C. suluensis</i>. Unfortunately, their color and pattern are very similar, and we cannot offer any fool-proof way of distinguishing female <i>C. prakkei</i> from <i>C. suluensis</i>. As far as we know, <i>C. prakkei</i> has only been collected near Sandakan in Sabah, but that does not mean they cannot occur elsewhere on the island.</p>

<p>Also <i>C. everetti</i> and <i>C. modesta</i> have a scalation similar to that of <i>C. suluensis</i>, but in those two species the first lower labials meet behind the mental, separating it from the anterior chin shields (not so in <i>C. suluensis</i>). Further, <i>C. everetti</i> often has a light ring around the body, not far behind the head, and often a dark mid-dorsal stripe on the anterior part of the body, whereas <i>C. modesta</i> usually has an eye diameter that is equal to or smaller than the eye-to-mouth distance (only rarely is the eye larger, like in <i>C. suluensis</i>).</p>

<p><i>C. grabowskyi</i> is also similar in scalation to <i>C. suluensis</i>. The number of ventrals is often higher in <i>C. grabowskyi</i> than in <i>C. suluensis</i> (as well as <i>C. everetti</i>), and <i>C. grabowskyi</i> usually has a rather characteristic reddish or brick-colored hue on the posterior part of the body.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Known from scattered locations across much of Borneo, although there seem to be no records from the southwestern part of the island. It can be found from the lowlands up to at least 1430 m ASL. Also known from the Sulu archipelago of the Philippines.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>We have seen photos of several snakes from around the Mount Kinabalu Park headquarters that appear to show either <i>C. suluensis</i>, <i>C. everetti</i>, <i>C. modesta</i>, or <i>C. prakkei</i>. Unfortunately, we know little or nothing about the underside of those snakes, so their identity remains unknown. This serves as a reminder to focus on the chin - does the mental touch the anterior chin shields? - and to take photos from which ventrals and subcaudals can be counted.</p>

<figcaption><i>Calamaria suluensis</i> from Sarawak (FMNH 67277). Notice that the mental touches the anterior chin shields. Also visible are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral. Barely discernible - but look closely - is that the first three lower labials touch the first chin shield. These are characters that may be the difference between a failed and a successful <i>Calamaria</i> identification, so remember to photograph the chin.<br><br>
