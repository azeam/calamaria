[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length or else the first and the second are larger than the third and fourth; the fifth is the longest. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.</p>

<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental is separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials. There are three or four gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.</p>

<p>The nasal and nostril are large, and cause a distinct bend in the lower side of the prefrontal.
</p>

<p>Preocular may be present or absent; postocular present. Eye smaller than the eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal slightly shorter than the frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.5 times as long as the prefrontal. Five or six scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two or three upper labials.</p>

<p>Because Inger & Marx (1965) examined very few <i>C. schlegeli</i> from Borneo, the key in this app uses the ventral and subcaudal counts from the whole range (not just Borneo). Below, we give both kinds of data.</p>

<p>Tail long and slender for a <i>Calamaria</i>, tapering gradually throughout most of its length. Length ratio [tail length / total length] in males from across the entire range 0.111 - 0.213 (n = 97), in males from Borneo 0.137 - 0.213 (n = 5?); in females from across the entire range 0.073 - 0.144 (n = 111), in females from Borneo 0.099 (n = 1). Males may actually have an even longer tail than this - see the photo below of FMNH 269038; a specimen of the unicolored morph from Sarawak that had 51/52 subcaudals, which is well above the previously recorded maximum of 44 subcaudals.</p>

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Up until recently, <i>C. schlegeli</i> was in Borneo considered to come in essentially two different color forms - a red-headed form (giving rise to the common name, Pink-headed Reed Snake) and a form with a head colored as the body / dorsum (the “unicolored” or “dark-headed” form). Inger & Marx (1965:157–158) described a more gradual transition in head color than that dual distinction, but they had a very small sample from Borneo and most present-day color photographs show snakes that have either an entirely red head or a head with no red color at all. Apart from difference in head color, these forms are similar in terms of having a uniformly dark (blackish) back and a uniformly pale (beige, white, or possibly yellowish) belly, with a sometimes differently colored light (white or yellow) ventrolateral stripe covering the first (lowest) dorsal scale row.</p>

<p>We now believe that a snake with yellow crossbands, which several people have photographed in eastern Sabah, is yet another color form of <i>C. schlegeli</i>. As far as we can tell, it has a very similar (if not identical) scalation - including a very large nasal/nostril - and it has a very long and slender tail with a high subcaudal count, which is characteristic for <i>C. schlegeli</i>. We still have not seen photos of the underside of this snake, so we cannot confirm that its mental is separated from the anterior chin shields; nor do we have counts of the ventrals or exact subcaudal counts. One small specimen (depicted below) had white rather than yellow crossbands; it also had a light-colored rear of the head, similar to another small specimen thought to be <i>C. schlegeli</i> from Bukit Bara Bukit Raya National Park in Central Kalimantan. That light-colored rear of the head was seen in some of the <i>C. schlegeli</i> specimens examined by Inger & Marx (1965), but none of those specimens came from Borneo - they were from the Malay Peninsula, western Sumatra and Pulau Belitung (formerly Billiton; an island between Sumatra and Borneo). It is perhaps not unlikely that Inger & Marx did not record this head color form from Borneo, given that they only examined six specimens from this island. Because they looked at preserved specimens, it is unclear what color (red, pink, yellow, or light flesh-colored as in one specimen depicted below) these snakes with “partially light” head color had in life.</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>Snakes with a uniformly dark dorsum and a light ventrolateral (and ventral) pattern like the unicolored form of <i>C. schlegeli</i> is often mistaken for <i>C. bicolor</i> - probably because it is so distinctly “bi-colored”. In fact, <i>C. bicolor</i> often looks very different (see photos in that species account), and it has small nasals/nostrils that are directed forward, sitting next to a tall but narrow rostral. <i>C. schlegeli</i> has a wider rostral and large nasals with almost flaring nostrils, that sit much more to the sides of the snout, where they cause an obvious bend in the lower side of the prefrontal. Also, the tail in <i>C. schlegeli</i> is longer and slenderer than that of <i>C. bicolor</i>.</p>

<p>The plain-colored form of <i>C. hilleniusi</i> has a coloration similar to <i>C. schlegeli</i>. The former has fewer subcaudals and a mental that touches the anterior chin shields. Some plain-colored <i>C. hilleniusi</i> have a light (yellow) marking reaching up onto the temporal region, towards the parietal; we have not seen that in any <i>C. schlegeli</i> from Borneo.</p>

<p>Unless you look at the belly, <i>C. lateralis</i> may be mistaken for <i>C. schlegeli</i>. Both have a uniformly dark dorsum and a yellow or white band low on the side of the body. However, the former has a belly that is almost as dark as the dorsum. Also, the light band on the side sits a little higher up in <i>C. lateralis</i> (on the second and part of the third scale rows) compared to <i>C. schlegeli</i> (first, or first and part of the second, scale rows). <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> usually has a longer tail with a higher number of subcaudals than <i>C. lateralis</i>. The nasal / nostril is smaller in <i>C. lateralis</i> than in <i>C. schlegeli</i>. If the snake does not have a preocular, it should be <i>C. schlegeli</i> and not <i>C. lateralis</i> - but presence of a preocular could mean either of these two species. If the snake’s postocular is seamlessly fused with the supraocular, it would indicate <i>C. lateralis</i> - but a distinct seam between those scales may be present in both these species.</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Records are from vastly different regions of the island, and it is probably spread throughout low and moderate elevations throughout the island. Malkmus et al. (2002) as well as the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/191990/2024825">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> states that it occurs up to 1000 m ASL, but it is unclear from what part of its wide distribution that applies to. The yellow-banded form has been found at Tawau Hills National Park and at Danum Valley; both in eastern Sabah. We have yet to see photos of the red-headed form from Sabah, but it appears to be somewhat common in western Sarawak. Apart from Borneo, <i>C. schlegeli</i> occurs in southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and on Sumatra, Java, and Bali.</p>

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>Inger & Marx (1965) examined a large number of specimens from throughout the Sunda region, and concluded that the head coloration is highly variable. We know little about how the red-headed versus unicolored forms are geographically distributed within Borneo. At Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in Central Kalimantan, Sam Howard found both the red-headed form and what we consider to be the unicolored form of <i>C. schlegeli</i> (see photos below), suggesting that the two forms may occur in sympatry. Could this be an indication that we are looking at two distinct taxa that have very similar scalation, but differing in coloration? There might also be a tendency towards the red-headed form having a longer and more slender snout (a more pointed head) and perhaps a slightly smaller eye than the unicolored form. We hope that future genetic studies will sample these forms in a geographically rigorous manner and investigate this question.</p>

<figcaption>The yellow-banded form of what we consider <i>Calamaria schlegeli</i> - here a specimen from Danum Valley, Sabah. Although we cannot see the underside of the snake, we can use dorsal scales to try and figure out how many subcaudals it may have had: it seems to have at least 40 subcaudals. The only Bornean Calamaria species with that many subcaudals is <i>C. schlegeli</i>. Although young specimens of <i>Calamaria lumbricoidea</i> have a similar dorsal and lateral pattern, that species has a tail that is considerably shorter and tapers more abruptly near the end.

The long and slender tail, the large nostril, a mental separated from the anterior chin shields by the first lower labials (seen in photos not shown in this app), and a large nasal/nostril all indicate so. The light patch on the rear of the head is similar to that in the juvenile of the banded form of <i>C.</i> cf. <i>schlegeli</i> from Tawau Hills (Sabah), seen above; one may also see some resemblance with the snake from Lubok Antu (Sarawak) depicted above.<br><br>
