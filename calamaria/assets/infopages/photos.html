<p>Unfortunately, many of the <i>Calamaria</i> photos posted online, or sent to us, do not show all the scale characters necessary to make a positive identification. Usually there are no photos showing the underside, and therefore no option to count how many ventrals and subcaudals the snake had; nor do we know if the mental touched the anterior chin shields. Often there is no photo showing the tail shape. Sometimes there are no close-up photos showing the scales around the eye and on the upper lip in sufficient detail. Considering how little we know about the variation in color and pattern of many Bornean <i>Calamaria</i> spp., a pretty portrait of the snake is often not enough to identify it.
</p>

<p>How can you take photos that show the scale characters essential for identification? Here we give some hints.
</p>

<p>But before attempting to handle and manipulate a snake for photography, carefully read what we say under the pages <a href="warning">Warning!</a> and <a href="ethics">Ethics and regulations</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>In the field</strong>, carry with you a large Petri dish with a lid. For snakes you are absolutely sure are harmless, gently place the snake in the dish. Try to make the snake lie in a neat spiral coil, so that no sections of the body overlap. Cover the dish with its lid. Photograph from underneath the dish, ideally at an angle so that your flash does not cause reflections in the plastic/glass of the dish. Then immediately scrutinize the images you just took; all ventral (and/or subcaudal) scales must be visible.
</p>

<p>In order to later measure from the photos the snake’s size and its relative tail length (described below), you also need shots of the snake taken with the focal plane perpendicular to the snake (not “at an angle”) and with something as a known size reference (e.g. a lens cap right next to the snake, or the Petri dish it might be sitting in). The flatter the snake lies, the better. A telephoto lens is better than a wide-angle lens, as the latter tends to distort perspectives. For just the total length, a photo from straight above is OK, but to calculate the relative tail length - which may benefit the identification - you need to see where the cloaca (vent, anal scale) is located. It requires that you shoot from below, and perpendicular to the container’s bottom - which may cause devastating reflections in the transparent fabric unless you shine a light, or aim the flash, from an angle. Review your photos before you consider it done.
</p>

<p>If you don’t have a Petri dish or a similar container with fully transparent walls, but still want photos that allow you to count ventrals, try holding the snake in the tail and shoot the ventral side when the snake is in a fairly flat focal plane, perpendicular to your camera, and the whole ventral side is visible from the camera’s point-of-view. [It usually takes several photos to get it right, and unless you wear gloves your blood may be oozing from bites inflicted by an annoyed snake.] Then take similar photos where the entire underside of the tail is seen, including the cloacal opening.
</p>

<p>Also take photos of the underside of the head, showing the chin scales and the lower labials. Try different exposures as the light chin often reflects light and the edges of the scales may be difficult to see in an overexposed photo!
</p>

<p>Try to practice these photography techniques at home, before heading out in the field.
</p>

<p><strong>Once at home</strong>, paste your photos into a presentation program on your computer. Create small dots and place one dot on each ventral, and on each subcaudal. I usually place a red dot on every 10th scale, and yellow dots in-between, which makes it easier to count (and to see where I might have made mistakes). If the delimitation of individual scales is hard to see, try adjusting exposure and contrast to make individual scales more easily defined. Sometimes looking at the adjacent dorsal scale row can help determine what is to be counted as a discrete ventral scale.
</p>

<p>The tricky part is to define what is the first (most anterior) ventral scale. As indicated in the species accounts, there are usually three somewhat narrower scales just behind the second pair of chin shields that do not qualify as true ventrals. Skip over them and start counting at the fourth scale after the chin shields - a ventral that reaches all the way to the “proper” dorsal scale rows. Do <em>not</em> include the actual anal scale (=vent) in your count of ventrals.
</p>

<p>All <i>Calamaria</i> have divided subcaudals - that is, there is one set on the left underside and another set (offset by half a subcaudal length) on the right underside. You count only those on one side, and you must not count the single (non-paired) scale that sits on the tail tip. It may be challenging to define what is the first “proper” subcaudal - sometimes there are one or two scales semi-hidden on each side of (and partially under) the anal scale’s rear corners, which do not meet their counterparts on the other side of the tail. We recommend not counting those small scales; instead start with the “proper” subcaudals behind the cloacal opening. The good thing is, when you’ve created a marked-up image like described above, you have a reference saved which can be screened and commented on by others. (If you do the counts in the field, without any photos, errors will never be revealed.)

<p>To measure the length (total length and tail length), use an image processing program to measure how long the snake body is relative to the size of the simultaneously depicted reference object that you know the size of, e.g. a lens cap. Some image processing programs allow you to place dots along curves — like a bending snake body — and measure the total distance.
</p>

<p>For future reference, it is good to save all the relevant marked-up photos and your associated comments on scale characters and scale counts in a single file, such as a presentation program slide. There you may also add info on where, when, at what altitude, and in what habitat you found the snake. Such a file is easy to share with others that may want to tune in on the snake’s identity. Give the file a logical name, such as <2018-05-31_Calamaria griswoldi_Kinabalu Park HQ_Your Name>.
</p>

<p>Finally, please <span>REMEMBER</span> that the venomous Banded Coral Snake (<i>Calliophis intestinalis</i>) may be very similar to <i>Calamaria lumbricoidea</i> - both have a barred ventral pattern, and sometimes a reddish head. Never ever handle an unidentified snake with bare hands unless you are absolutely sure it is a non-venomous species.
