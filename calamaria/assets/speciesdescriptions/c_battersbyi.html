[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Four upper labials, with the second and third touching the eye; first upper labial almost as wide as the second, third half as wide as the second, fourth the longest. Five lower labials; the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>
<p>The rostral is wider than it is high. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>
<p>Preocular as high as, but narrower than, the postocular. Eye diameter larger than eye–to–mouth distance, and larger than the height of the pre- and postocular – beware, though, that this was based on a small juvenile specimen, and they often have relatively large eyes.
</p>
<p>Length of prefrontal about same as length of frontal; length of frontal ca three-quarters that of parietal; parietal (almost) 1.5 times longer than prefrontal. Six scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
</p>
<p>Tail short and thick, tapering abruptly at the end. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.065 (n = 1; the holotype).
</p>
<p>Ventrals in males: 171 (n = 1; the type specimen).<br>
Subcaudals in males: 16 (n = 1; the type specimen).<br><br>
Ventrals in females: unknown.<br>
Subcaudals in females: unknown.

[section]Color and pattern[/section] 
<p>Body assumed to be brown above. Anteriorly, the holotype has eight dark stripes along the sides and top of the body. Towards the rear of the body, stripes also appear in the edge between the ventrals and the first dorsal scale row, and thus there are 10 stripes posteriorly. There is a narrow light ring around the body seven scales behind the head, a ring around the base of the tail, and a dorsally interrupted ring at the middle of the tail. Each ventral scale is dark anteriorly and light posteriorly (similar to the ventrals in <i>C. melanota</i>). The underside of the tail has a dark stripe along its center. Beware that this is based on one specimen only; a 92-mm long juvenile.

[section]Similar species[/section] 
<p><i>Calamaria borneensis</i> comes in different patterns and has often been mistaken for <i>C. battersbyi</i>. To tell them apart, look at the chin: do the first two lower labials touch the anterior chin shield (= <i>C. borneensis</i>), or do the first three lower labials touch the anterior chin shield (= <i>C. battersbyi</i>; also <i>C. melanota</i>)? [See illustrations of those scale arrangements in the species accounts for <i>C. borneensis</i> and <i>C. melanota</i>.]
</p>
<p>Scale characters in <i>C. battersbyi</i> are similar to those in <i>C. melanota</i>, which appears to lack longitudinal stripes along the body and instead has a rather characteristic pattern with light or yellow dots on the lower scale rows, especially at the front of the body. <i>Calamaria melanota</i> also has a longer tail (length ratio = 0.116 – 0.130 in males) with a higher number of subcaudals (23 – 26 in males); a tail that is not as blunt at the end as in <i>C. battersbyi</i>, but starts to taper gradually from the middle. Although Inger & Marx (1965) say that <i>C. melanota</i> and <i>C. battersbyi</i> differ in the relative sizes of their upper labials, it is not entirely clear from their description what the difference is.

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>The holotype came from “Tandjong, southeastern Borneo”, which might be current-day Tanjung on the border between South and Central Kalimantan, or a site further east in the southernmost part of East Kalimantan, or <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192125/2043564">possibly</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> west of the Melawi watershed in West Kalimantan. It has not been found anywhere else and is thus considered endemic to Borneo.

[section]Comment[/section]
<p>We are unaware of any photos or drawings of <i>C. battersbyi</i>. Photos have been posted online of snakes from western Sarawak that were initially suspected to be <i>C. battersbyi</i>, but they are now identified as <i>C. borneensis</i>. If you find a suspected <i>C. battersbyi</i> (or <i>C. melanota</i> or <i>C. borneensis</i>), remember to photograph the chin. Try your best to also take photos allowing you to count ventrals and subcaudals. Also try to take photos perpendicular from underneath where the entire underside – from head to tail – is seen, so that you can later measure from the photo (with a computer program such as ImageJ) the tail length ratio. Knowing the sex of the focal individual would be valuable.
