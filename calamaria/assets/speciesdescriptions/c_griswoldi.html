[section]Scalation and shape[/section]
<p>Five upper labials, with the third and fourth touching the eye; the first four are of somewhat similar length, the fifth is longer. Five lower labials, the first three touching the anterior chin shields.
</p>

<p>The rostral is either wider than it is high, or equally high as wide. The mental touches the anterior chin shields. There are three gulars in the midline between the posterior chin shields and the first ventral scale.
</p>

<p>Preocular and postocular present; neither is as tall as the eye diameter. Eye diameter equal to, or slightly larger than, eye–to–mouth distance.
</p>

<p>Prefrontal slightly shorter than the frontal; length of frontal two-thirds to three-quarters of the parietal’s length; parietal ca 1.6 - 2 times as long as the prefrontal. Five scales surround the paraparietal. The prefrontal touches the first two upper labials.
</p>

<p>Tail rather thick, tapers gradually from the vent and then more steeply near the end; the tail tip is sharp. Length ratio [total length / tail length] in males 0.059 - 0.068 (n = 6), in females 0.048 - 0.056 (n = 4).

[section]Color and pattern[/section]
<p>Body characteristically striped in yellow and black on the sides and usually on top of the dorsum; belly and the first (lowermost) scale row uniformly yellow or orange. The lowermost black stripe sits on the second scale row; above that are usually 5 yellow stripes on each side of the dorsal midline, so 10 yellow stripes in total. The pattern is often bright, but duller in some specimens; occasionally the black stripes take over mid-dorsally and obscure the yellow stripes on the top of the back. Tail underneath yellow, sometimes tending towards orange; with or without a dark median stripe.
</p>

[section]Similar species[/section]
<p>This is not the only <i>Calamaria</i> that can be striped, but no other Bornean species is so distinctly striped in yellow and black. For specimens with dull or faint stripes that are not bright yellow, carefully check scale characters. <i>Calamaria lumbricoidea</i> may look similar dorsally, but has a belly patterned very differently.
</p>

[section]Distribution[/section]
<p>Common in (sub)montane forest around Mount Kinabalu, Sabah; also recorded from the Kelabit Plateau in northeastern Sarawak. We are not aware of any records from the Crocker Range or other montane areas of southwestern Sabah, but it probably occurs there. Exact altitudinal range not known; most records seem to be from ca 1350 - 1550 m ASL but the IUCN Red List <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/191944/2019288">assessment</a> <img src="asset:assets/icons/external.png"> says it has been found as low as 1000 m ASL. Rather common at the Kinabalu Park headquarters. Endemic to Borneo.

<figcaption>Tails of <i>Calamaria griswoldi</i> from Mount Kinabalu, Sabah (FMNH 152154 and 152155). Although the tail tapers more rapidly close to the tip, it is considered to taper throughout its length because it starts to taper already at the tail base (Inger & Marx 1965:92). As we have pointed out elsewhere, there may be individual variation, some of which is attributed to sex (as males have hemipenes stored inside the tail).
