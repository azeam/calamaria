<p>This app does not imply that you are always allowed to disturb (catch and handle) snakes to closely examine them. You should obey any national park regulations as well as other laws that apply to the state and country you are in. Regardless which political entity (in Borneo) you are in, doing formal research is surrounded by many rules and regulations - it is really just an option for officially accredited researchers. However, just identifying a snake does not constitute research - it is no different from birding or other recreational activities enjoyed by amateur naturalists.

<p>If you are able to capture a snake legally for the sake of examination, first read what we say in the <a href="warning">warning page</a> under the Main Menu. If you then consider it perfectly safe to examine a living snake you have encountered, please consider the following.

<p>Small snakes can be fragile and delicate. <i>Calamaria</i> spp. have a reputation that they may die after handling. We do not know if they really are more sensitive to handling than other snakes. This notion might perhaps stem from people keeping them overnight in cloth bags in order to examine them further in the morning, only to find that the snake is then dead. That might possibly result from excessive water loss: <i>Calamaria</i> spp. as well as <i>Pseudorabdion</i> spp. usually burrow in moist soil or leaf litter, and they may be particularly prone to rapid desiccation when kept too dry — such as in a cloth bag, especially if it is kept indoors. Whatever the true reason is for such snake mortalities, err on the cautious side and try to be very gentle if handling these small snakes! Try to examine (and photograph) them quickly, and then let them go right where you found them. Avoid keeping them captive, even if just overnight — it results in stress and, possibly, their death.

<p>If you are at a site where it would not violate any laws or regulations to preserve a snake that was already dead when you found it (usually a roadkill), preserving it in alcohol and handing it over to a local institution/researcher that deals with snakes could help to verify its identity and possibly contribute new knowledge.</p>
